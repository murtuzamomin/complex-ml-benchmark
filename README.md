# Complex ML Benchmark Dataset

## Overview
A comprehensive synthetic dataset designed for benchmarking machine learning algorithms on complex, non-linear patterns and intricate feature interactions. This dataset specifically tests model capabilities in handling high-dimensional spaces with sophisticated relationships.

## Dataset Specifications
- **Samples**: 500,000
- **Features**: 40 carefully engineered features
- **Feature Types**: 
  - 15 highly complex numeric features (non-linear transformations)
  - 5 moderately complex numeric features
  - 5 simple numeric features  
  - 15 categorical features (varying cardinality 2-50)
- **Target**: Complex variable with multi-feature interactions and controlled noise

## Installation & Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
